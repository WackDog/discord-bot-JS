# Discord bot made in discord.js

Pushed from replit, raw code for a general use discord bot.
* Prefix is f!, list of commands available from f!help. Viewable in index.js line 310-340.
* Originally used with secret variable for bot token, variable would need replaced when used elsewhere.

### Note:
Pushing from an older hosting website has forced a commit to be named "a", this commit is simply a file update with minor line changes.
